## 1. Overview

STORM is a standalone desktop application purpose-built for severe weather storm chasing situational awareness. It integrates offline vector maps, real-time NEXRAD radar, GOES satellite imagery, SPC/NWS hazard products, collaborative field annotations, meteorological drawings, and live multi-vehicle tracking — all in a single interface designed to function reliably in the field.

**Core Technology Stack:**

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| UI Framework | PyQt6 (QMainWindow + QWebEngineView) |
| Map Renderer | MapLibre GL JS (embedded in browser engine) |
| Vector Tiles | Offline MBTiles served via custom `storm://` URL scheme |
| Radar Decoding | MetPy + matplotlib (Level 3, Unidata THREDDS) |
| Satellite Imagery | IEM WMS (GOES-East, GOES-West) |
| SFCOA Mesoanalysis | NSSL SFCOA vector tiles |
| Hazard Data | SPC GeoJSON MapServer + NWS API |
| Vehicle/Annotation Sync | MQTT over AWS IoT (TLS) |
| Python-to-JS Bridge | QWebChannel (`bridge` object) |

**Run Command:**
```bash
conda activate storm
python main.py
```

**Platform-Specific Launchers:**
- **macOS:** Double-click `STORM.app` (created via `bash scripts/create_app.sh`)
- **Linux:** Use desktop launcher (created via `bash scripts/create_desktop_entry.sh`)
- **Windows:** Double-click desktop shortcut (created via setup script)

---

## 2. Installation & Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 via conda (Miniforge, Miniconda, or Anaconda)
- conda environment: `storm` (created via `python setup.py` or `conda env create -f envs/storm.yml`)
- The offline MBTiles vector tile database (`storm.mbtiles`, ~500 MB–1 GB, distributed separately)

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobbysaba/storm.git
cd storm
python setup.py
```

The setup script creates the conda environment and desktop launcher automatically. See the README for detailed installation instructions.

### MQTT Certificates
Certain network features (vehicle sync, annotation/drawing sync) require AWS IoT TLS certificates. Place them at:
- `aws/storm.pem` — CA certificate
- `aws/storm.pem.crt` — device certificate
- `aws/storm-private.pem.key` — private key
- `aws/storm-public.pem.key` — public key

If certificates are missing, STORM starts in a degraded state — map, radar, satellite, and SPC/NWS hazard features remain fully functional, but MQTT-dependent sync features are disabled.

### Single-Instance Guard
Only one instance of STORM can run per machine (an internal port is used as a lock). If a second launch is attempted, a warning dialog appears and the second instance exits immediately.

---

## 3. Launching STORM

### Launch Dialog

Every time STORM starts, a configuration dialog appears before the main window opens.

#### Launch Mode

Choose one of three mutually exclusive roles for this session:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **VEHICLE** | Full participant — publishes local obs (file watcher / GPS) and syncs annotations, drawings, and cones over MQTT. Requires a vehicle passphrase. |
| **MONITOR** | View-only participant — all map overlays and MQTT inbound work, but no local obs are published. Requires a monitor passphrase. |
| **VIEWER** | Fully offline / no-network mode — no MQTT, no obs publishing. Map, radar, satellite, and SPC/NWS hazards still function. |
| **ARCHIVE** | Replay a past session — enter a UTC date/time and STORM fetches and plays back historical radar, satellite, hazards, soundings, and MQTT vehicle positions synchronized to a central time controller. Requires a passphrase. See [Section 8](#8-archive-mode). |

#### Archive Config (ARCHIVE mode only)

When ARCHIVE is selected, the vehicle-specific fields (ID, icon, data directory) are hidden and replaced with:

**Archive Start Time (UTC)**
A date/time picker (calendar popup + time fields) for choosing the UTC start time of the replay session. STORM will fetch historical data beginning at this timestamp. All data products (radar, satellite, hazards, soundings, vehicle positions) replay from this time.

**Passphrase**
Archive mode requires a passphrase for authentication (separate from vehicle/monitor passphrases).

The archive start time is not saved between sessions — each archive launch requires an explicit selection.

---

#### Vehicle Config (VEHICLE mode only)

**Vehicle ID**
Your vehicle's identifier on the network (e.g., "Chase1", "Mesonet-TX"). Pre-filled from the previous session; edit freely. The ID is published with every observation, annotation, and drawing you send to other vehicles.

**Vehicle Icon**
Choose the icon that represents your vehicle on the map. Options: car, drone, mesonet, lidar, radar, hailcam.

**Data Directory (Track A)**
Optional folder path for a local FOFS instrument logger. If left blank, file-watcher input is disabled for the session. Use **Browse** to pick a folder. The app scans for `YYYYMMDD.txt` and polls it every 10 seconds.

#### Data on Launch (collapsible)

A collapsible section lets you pre-select which data layers to enable automatically on startup:

- **SPC / NWS / RADAR** — multi-select toggle buttons to auto-enable those overlays
- **Satellite** — exclusive selector: OFF | CONUS | AUTO-MESO
- **Surface obs** — multi-select: OK MESONET | WTM

#### Update Status

During startup STORM checks for available updates. The dialog shows:
- "Checking for updates…" while polling
- Current and latest version numbers if an update is available
- An "Update Available" button (STORM never auto-updates)

**Launch**
Click **LAUNCH** to proceed. Vehicle ID, icon, data directory, and mode are saved to persistent settings and pre-filled next time.

## 6. Floating Toolbar

The floating toolbar lives in the top-left corner of the map window. Each button either toggles a layer directly or expands a collapsible drawer with additional controls. Drawers animate open/closed smoothly.

---

### 6.1 Radar

**Button:** `RADAR` (checkable toggle)

Clicking the button expands the radar drawer. Checking the checkbox inside enables radar fetching and display.

#### Drawer Controls

**Site Selector (dropdown)**
Choose from pre-configured NEXRAD sites (e.g., KTLX, KOUN, KVNX, KDYX, KFWS, etc.) or type a custom 4-letter site code. Changing the site immediately clears cached frames and begins fetching for the new site.

**Product Selector (dropdown)**

| Option | NEXRAD Product | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| REFLECTIVITY (SR) | N0B (fallback: N0Q → N0R) | Base reflectivity (dBZ) |
| VELOCITY | N0U | Base velocity (kt) |

**Show Data Checkbox**
Enables or disables radar fetching. When unchecked, radar is hidden from the map but site/product selections are preserved.

#### Playback Controls

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ⏮ | Jump to oldest cached frame |
| ⏪ | Step back one frame |
| ▶ / ⏸ | Start / pause auto-playback loop |
| ⏩ | Step forward one frame |
| ⏭ | Jump to most recent (live) frame |
| Timeline slider | Scrub to any cached frame by dragging |
| Time label | Shows current frame's UTC time (HH:MMZ) |
| Speed dropdown | Playback speed: 0.5× (1000 ms), 1× (500 ms), 2× (250 ms), 3× (167 ms) |

#### How Radar Data Works

- **Source:** Unidata THREDDS Level 3 catalog (public, no authentication required)
- **Polling:** Every 2 minutes
- **Frame cache:** Up to 12 frames per product
- **First fetch:** Backfills 6 reflectivity frames and 6 velocity frames
- **Render pipeline:** Level 3 polar data decoded by MetPy → reprojected to lat/lon grid → rendered as RGBA PNG via matplotlib → base64-encoded → pushed to MapLibre as a raster layer
- **Grid size:** Dynamic by default, starting at 768×768 (configurable via `--render-grid-size`)
- **Render time:** ~140–260 ms on modern hardware at 768×768

#### Disabling Radar

Pass `--disable-radar` at launch to hide the RADAR button entirely.

---

### 6.2 Hazards

**Button:** `HAZARDS` (checkable toggle)

Clicking the button expands the hazards drawer. The drawer contains two groups of controls.

#### SPC Products (mutually exclusive — only one active at a time)

| Button | Layer |
|--------|-------|
| **OUTLOOK** | Day 1 categorical outlook (MRGL, SLGHT, ENH, MDT, HIGH) |
| **TOR** | Tornado probability (2% / 5% / 10% / 15% / 30% / 45% / 60%) |
| **WIND** | Wind probability (5% / 15% / 30% / 45% / 60%) |
| **HAIL** | Hail probability (5% / 15% / 30% / 45% / 60%) |

Selecting one clears the others. Clicking the already-active button deactivates it (all SPC probability layers hidden).

#### Additive Overlays (independent, stack on top of each other)

| Button | Layer |
|--------|-------|
| **WATCHES** | SPC Tornado and Severe Thunderstorm Watch county polygons |
| **MDs** | SPC Mesoscale Discussion polygons with number labels |
| **NWS WARNINGS** | Active NWS warnings (all VTEC phenomenons) |

These can be enabled in any combination, independent of the SPC product selection.

#### Legend

When any hazard product is active, a compact color legend row appears below the drawer controls showing color swatches and probability labels. It animates in and out with the drawer.

#### Clicking Hazard Features

**SPC Categorical / Tornado / Wind / Hail polygons:**
- Click a polygon → popup with risk level and probability label
- Click "Read Discussion" in the popup → fetches full text from IEM/SPC and displays it in the [Outlook Panel](#8-outlook-text-panel)

**Watches:**
- Click a county-polygon → popup with watch number, type (Tornado or Severe Thunderstorm), and issuance details
- Click "Read" → fetches full SEL bulletin text and displays it in the Outlook Panel

**Mesoscale Discussions:**
- Click an MD polygon → popup with MD number
- Click "Read" → fetches full MD text from SPC and displays it in the Outlook Panel

**NWS Warnings:**
- Click a warning polygon → popup with product type, event number, and NWS headline
- Full description and instructions fetched from the NWS API and shown in the popup

#### Significant Area Hatching

SPC tornado, wind, and hail probability layers include significant (CIG/SIGN) areas as separate overlapping features rendered with gray fill plus hatch patterns:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Dashed diagonal lines | Conditional Intensity Group 1 (CIG1) |
| Solid diagonal lines | CIG2 or SIGN (significant tornado area) |
| Checkerboard | CIG3 |

#### Color Reference

**SPC Categorical:**

| Category | Color |
|----------|-------|
| MRGL (Marginal) | Green |
| SLGHT (Slight) | Yellow |

**NWS Warnings by VTEC Phenom:**

| Phenom | Event | Color |
|--------|-------|-------|
| TO | Tornado Warning | Red (#FF0000) |
| SV | Severe Thunderstorm Warning | Gold (#FFD700) |
| FF | Flash Flood Warning | Green (#00FF00) |
| FL | Flood Warning | Cyan-green (#00FF7F) |
| WS | Winter Storm Warning | Pink (#FF69B4) |
| BZ | Blizzard Warning | Orange-red (#FF4500) |

**Mesoscale Discussions:** Magenta (#FF66CC) outline

#### Data Polling

| Product | Interval | Cache TTL |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| SPC Categorical + Probabilities | 15 min | 15 min |
| SPC Watches | 2 min | None (always fresh) |
| SPC MDs | 2 min | None |
| NWS Warnings | 2 min | None |

When you toggle a product on within the cache window, data displays instantly from cache. After TTL expiry, a fresh fetch is triggered automatically.

---

### 6.3 Satellite

**Button:** `SATELLITE` (checkable toggle)

Clicking the button expands the satellite drawer.

#### Coverage Mode Selection

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CONUS** | Full continental US view (1600×800 px, updates every 5 min) |
| **MESO-1** | Mesoscale sector 1 (1024×1024 px, updates every 1 min) |
| **MESO-2** | Mesoscale sector 2 (1024×1024 px, updates every 1 min) |

MESO-1 and MESO-2 buttons are disabled until the satellite system confirms those sectors are available. Hover over MESO-1 or MESO-2 buttons to preview the sector boundary on the map as a semi-transparent overlay.

#### Opacity Slider

Controls satellite image transparency from 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully opaque). Default is 70%. Useful for seeing underlying map features through the imagery.

#### Playback Controls

Identical layout to the radar playback row:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ⏮ | Jump to oldest frame |
| ⏪ | Step back one frame |
| ▶ / ⏸ | Start / pause auto-playback |
| ⏩ | Step forward one frame |
| ⏭ | Jump to newest frame |
| Timeline slider | Scrub to any cached frame |
| Time label | Current frame UTC time (--:--Z if no data yet) |
| Speed dropdown | Playback speed: 0.5× (1200 ms), 1× (600 ms), 2× (300 ms), 3× (200 ms) |

#### How Satellite Data Works

- **Source:** IEM GOES-East WMS (`mesonet.agron.iastate.edu`) serving current operational GOES satellite (GOES-19 as of 2025)
- **Request format:** WMS GetMap PNG
- **Frame cache:** Up to 10 frames per mode
- **CONUS polling:** Every 5 minutes; 10 frames backfilled on mode selection
- **MESO polling:** Every 1 minute once sectors are confirmed available
- **Memory usage:** CONUS ~10–20 MB; each MESO sector ~20–30 MB

---

### 6.4 Soundings

**Button:** `SOUNDINGS` (checkable toggle, expands drawer)

Select which data source to use for Skew-T log-P soundings. Only one source is active at a time. Deactivating the button resets to HRRR mode.

| Button | Source | How to Trigger |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **HRRR** | NCEP HRRR model via open-meteo (no API key) | Click anywhere on the map |
| **OBS** | Observed radiosondes via IEM RAOB API | Radiosonde station markers appear; click one |
| **NSSL** | NSSL CLAMPS DL truck soundings via THREDDS | CLAMPS markers appear when data is available; click one |

In HRRR mode, a click on the map immediately starts fetching. In OBS and NSSL modes, station/truck markers are rendered on the map first; clicking a marker fetches and opens the sounding dialog.

See [Section 10](#10-point-soundings) for full dialog documentation.

---

### 6.5 Surface Obs

**Button:** `SURFACE` (checkable toggle, expands drawer)

Displays live surface observation station models from OK Mesonet, West Texas Mesonet, and ASOS/AWOS stations.

#### Network Toggles (multi-select)

| Button | Network | Coverage |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **OK MESONET** | Oklahoma Mesonet (OU) | ~120 stations across Oklahoma |
| **WTM** | West Texas Mesonet (TTU) | ~50 stations across West Texas |
| **ASOS** | IEM ASOS/AWOS current observations | User-drawn bounding box |

Any combination can be active at once. OK Mesonet and WTM poll independently every 5 minutes. ASOS fetches stations inside the selected bounding box and refreshes that saved domain on the same surface-observation timer.

#### ASOS Bounding Box

When **ASOS** is enabled for the first time, the map enters bounding-box mode:

1. Click and drag on the map to draw the ASOS domain.
2. Release the mouse to accept the box.
3. STORM fetches current ASOS/AWOS observations from IEM for stations inside that box.
4. Station plots render on the map. Large boxes may briefly pause the UI while plots are prepared.

Toggling ASOS off and back on reuses the last selected bounding box. To replace it, click the **new box** link in the surface status text, then draw a new domain.

#### Station Model Display

Each station renders a compact model circle on the map showing:

| Position | Data |
|----------|------|
| Upper-left | Temperature (°F) |
| Lower-left | Dewpoint (°F) |
| Center | Wind barb |
| Upper-right | Pressure in mb/hPa |

Toggle station models on or off with the **Show plots** checkbox.

#### Freshness Coloring

The station-plot center dot is colored by observation age, not fetch time. OK Mesonet and WTM use short freshness thresholds because they report frequently. ASOS uses wider thresholds because routine reports are typically hourly:

| Source | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| OK Mesonet / WTM | ≤5 min | ≤10 min | >10 min |
| ASOS | ≤70 min | ≤90 min | >90 min |

The ASOS timestamp comes from IEM's `valid` observation time.

#### Data Sources

| Source | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| OK Mesonet | NSSL THREDDS OK Mesonet JSON + Oklahoma Mesonet metadata |
| West Texas Mesonet | NSSL THREDDS WTM JSON + TTU Mesonet site metadata |
| ASOS/AWOS | IEM `currents.json` for selected station IDs; station metadata from IEM METAR GeoJSON |

---

### 6.6 SFCOA Mesoanalysis

**Button:** `SFCOA` (checkable toggle, expands drawer)

Displays NSSL SFCOA mesoanalysis contour products as labeled vector-tile overlays. SFCOA is available in normal user sessions and does not require admin mode.

#### Product Groups

SFCOA variables are grouped into compact columns so related fields are easy to scan:

| Group | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **SURFACE** | Near-surface thermodynamic fields |
| **PARCEL** | Parcel diagnostics |
| **LAPSE RATES** | Low- and mid-level lapse-rate fields |
| **SHEAR** | Bulk shear fields |
| **SRH** | Storm-relative helicity fields |
| **COMPOSITE** | Composite severe-weather parameters |
| **UPPER AIR** | Upper-air diagnostics |
| **WINDS** | Kinematic wind products |

Click one or more product buttons to add those contours to the map. Clicking a selected product removes it. Active products remain selected when stepping between valid times if that variable is available at the new time.

#### Valid-Time Controls

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **REFRESH** | Reload the SFCOA catalog and product list |
| ⏮ | Jump to the oldest available valid time |
| ⏪ | Step back one valid time |
| ⏩ | Step forward one valid time |
| ⏭ | Jump to the latest available valid time |
| Status label | Shows the selected valid time, product count, or current loading state |

#### How SFCOA Data Works

- **Source:** NSSL SFCOA catalog via `SFCOA_BASE_URL`
- **Render format:** MapLibre vector tiles with contour lines and labels
- **Layer behavior:** SFCOA is mutually exclusive with other large overlay drawers so the toolbar stays readable
- **Caching:** Selected product/time combinations are cached during the session for faster stepping back to recently viewed fields

---

### 6.7 Routing

**Button:** `ROUTING` (checkable toggle, expands drawer)

Provides turn-by-turn driving directions rendered on the map.

#### Setting Origin and Destination

- **Origin:** Type an address, lat/lon pair, or click **Use My Location** to use the current GPS position.
- **Destination:** Type an address or lat/lon pair, or click a point on the map while the destination field is focused.

Click **Get Directions** to fetch the route. The route geometry is drawn on the map as a colored line, and the directions list appears below with each maneuver's distance and turn arrow (↑, ←, →, ↖, ↗, ↩, etc.).

#### Auto-Re-Routing

If the vehicle drifts more than 100 m off the calculated route for 3 or more consecutive GPS fixes, STORM automatically re-fetches directions from the current position.

#### Arrival

When the vehicle is within 30 m of the destination, STORM shows an arrival notification and clears the route from the map.

#### Data Sources

| Function | Service |
|----------|---------|
| Turn-by-turn routing | OSRM public demo server (`router.project-osrm.org`) |
| Address geocoding | Nominatim (`nominatim.openstreetmap.org`) |

---

### 6.8 Annotations

**Button:** `ANNOTATIONS` (checkable toggle, expands drawer)

Annotations are field-condition markers placed on the map and synced to all vehicles over MQTT.

#### Annotation Types

| Icon | Type | Color | Use For |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| ✕ | Road Closure | Red (#E53935) | Blocked road — no through traffic |
| ▲ | Construction | Yellow (#FFD166) | Active road work |
| ~ | Flooded Road | Blue (#4A9EFF) | Standing water over road |
| ⚡ | Downed Power Lines | Yellow (#FFD166) | Electrical hazard on road |
| ! | Road Debris | Orange (#FF6B35) | Debris field on road |

#### Placing an Annotation

1. Click the desired annotation type button in the drawer — it highlights in that type's color.
2. Click any location on the map.
3. A dialog opens showing the clicked coordinates and an optional "Note" text field.
4. Add any relevant note (e.g., "Road completely blocked at intersection with CR-1234").
5. Click **Add to Map**.
6. The annotation marker appears on the map immediately and is published to all connected vehicles via MQTT.

#### Editing or Deleting an Annotation

1. Click an existing annotation marker on the map.
2. The edit dialog opens, pre-filled with the existing note.
3. Edit the note or click **Delete** to remove it.
4. Click **Save** to confirm.

#### Moving an Annotation

1. Click an existing annotation marker on the map.
2. In the edit dialog, click **Move**.
3. The dialog closes and the marker becomes draggable — drag it to the new location.
4. On drop, a confirmation dialog shows the old and new coordinates.
5. Click **Confirm** to save the new position, or **Cancel** to revert.

Changes, moves, and deletions are published to all connected vehicles.

> **Note:** When the routing or measure tool is active, clicking on an annotation will forward the click to the active tool instead of opening the edit dialog.

---

### 6.9 Drawings

**Button:** `DRAWINGS` (collapsible drawer)

Drawings are meteorological features sketched on the map — synced to all vehicles over MQTT.

#### Drawing Types

**Fronts:**

| Button | Front | Symbol | Color |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|

---

### 6.10 Storm Motion Cone

**Button:** `CONE`

Places a storm motion cone on the map — a forward-propagating sector showing the expected storm track with a 20° angular spread and time rings.

#### Creating a Cone

1. Click the **CONE** button.
2. Click any location on the map (typically the current storm location).
3. A dialog opens with two fields:
   - **Speed (knots):** Expected storm forward speed. Default 35 kts. Range: 0–200.
   - **Heading (degrees):** Direction the storm is moving *toward*. Default 240° (toward the SSW). Range: 0–359.
4. Click **Add to Map**.

The rendered cone includes:
- A base point at the clicked location
- Two radial bounding lines extending 1 hour of travel at ±20° spread
- Concentric time rings at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 hour
- A center spine line showing the primary motion direction

**Color:** Cyan (#00CFFF)

#### Editing or Deleting a Cone

1. Click the cone on the map.
2. The dialog shows the current speed and heading.
3. Update the values or click **Delete**.
4. Click **Save**.

Cones are synced via MQTT (`storm/cones/{id}` topic).

#### Disabled If

`--disable-annotations` is passed at launch.

### 6.11 Measurement Tool

**Button:** `MEASURE` (checkable toggle)

Measures great-circle distances on the map.

#### Usage

1. Click the **MEASURE** button — the map cursor changes to a crosshair.
2. Click a start point on the map — a dot appears.
3. Move the mouse — a preview line and live distance label follow the cursor.
4. Click an end point — the segment is fixed.
5. Continue clicking to measure additional segments (multi-segment path).
6. **Finish:** Right-click or press **Escape**.
7. Distance is shown in miles (e.g., "47.3 mi") with total path length.

**Clear:** A **Clear** button removes all measurement geometry from the map.

**Color:** Cyan lines and labels

---

### 6.12 Station Plots

**Button:** `STATION PLOTS` (checkable toggle)

Displays MetPy-style meteorological station plot icons at each tracked vehicle's current position.

#### Station Plot Layout

```
  [Temp °F]   [Pressure mb]
       ○──wind barb
  [Dewpt °F]
```

| Position | Data | Color |
|----------|------|-------|
| Upper-left (NW) | Temperature (°F) | Red text |
| Lower-left (SW) | Dewpoint (°F) | Green text |
| Upper-right (NE) | Pressure in mb/hPa, rounded to nearest whole value | White text |
| Center | Wind barb (meteorological convention, barbs point toward station) | White |
| Center dot | Anchor | White circle |

**Wind Calm:** If wind speed is ≤2 kt, only a small circle is rendered (no barbs).

#### How Station Plots Are Rendered

Station plots are generated as PNG images (135×135 px, transparent background) by MetPy and matplotlib, then pushed to the map as image markers. Each vehicle's plot is cached and only re-rendered when new observation data arrives.

#### Disabled If

`--disable-annotations` is passed at launch.

---

### 6.13 Deployment Locations

**Button:** `DEPLOY LOCS` (checkable toggle, expands drawer)

Displays historical deployment locations as markers on the map, filtered by research quality metrics.

#### Quality Metric Selector

| Button | Metric | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **RANK_ABI** | ABI Rank | Rank by ABI-derived quality index |
| **RANK_AOI** | AOI Rank | Rank by area-of-interest quality |
| **RQI** | Road Quality Index | Continuous road surface quality score (0–1) |

#### Threshold Slider

A slider controls the minimum quality threshold. Only locations meeting or exceeding the threshold are shown. The legend below the slider shows a green → red color ramp corresponding to the quality range, updated live as you drag.

#### Marker Radius

An additional slider controls the displayed circle radius for each location marker.

#### Data Source

- **File:** `locs/deployment_locations.csv`
- Markers are pre-loaded at startup; toggling visibility or threshold is instant.

#### Disabled If

`--disable-deploy-locs` is passed at launch, or the locations file is missing.

---

### 6.14 Vehicle Panel

**Button:** `VEHICLES` (toggles the right-side dock panel)

The vehicle panel provides a live roster of all tracked vehicles and time-series observation graphs.

#### Vehicle List (upper section)

Each vehicle row shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ID** | Vehicle identifier (e.g., "Chase1") |
| **Position** | Compact lat/lon (e.g., "35.24 | -97.45") |
| **Last Update** | Relative time (e.g., "just now", "2 min ago") |
| **Color dot** | Matches the vehicle's marker color on the map |

Click a vehicle row to **zoom the map to that vehicle's location**.

Vehicles are sorted by most-recently-updated first.

#### Vehicle Detail Section (lower section)

When a vehicle is selected, the detail section shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Temperature** | Current temperature in °F (red text) |

#### Three Subplots (shared x-axis)

**1. Temperature / Dewpoint**
- Red line: Temperature (°F)
- Green line: Dewpoint (°F)
- Y-axis label: °F

**2. Wind Speed / Direction (dual y-axes)**
- Cyan line: Wind speed (kt) — left y-axis
- Yellow scatter points: Wind direction (deg) — right y-axis
- Left y-axis label: kt
- Right y-axis label: deg

**3. Pressure**
- Purple line: Pressure (mb)
- Y-axis label: mb

#### Data Grid & Gap Handling

Observations are snapped to a 10-second time grid. Missing data becomes NaN, creating visual gaps in the plots without connecting across missing points. This prevents misleading interpolation across data outages.

#### Interactive Features

**Inline Legend / Cursor Readout**
Each subplot has an inline legend rendered directly below its axis (similar to uPlot's built-in legend). At rest, the legend shows series names with `--` placeholder values. Hover over any subplot to update all three legends with the timestamp and current values at that point:
- Temperature and dewpoint (below panel 1)
- Wind speed and direction (below panel 2)
- Pressure (below panel 3)

The cursor snaps to the nearest 10-second grid point and only displays values where actual observations exist (no readouts in data gaps). A vertical crosshair line appears across all three subplots at the snapped time.

**Scroll Wheel Zoom**
Scroll the mouse wheel while hovering over any subplot to zoom in/out on the x-axis, centered on the cursor position. Zoom applies to all three subplots simultaneously (shared x-axis).

**Click-Drag Selection Zoom**
Click and drag horizontally across any subplot to select a time range. A translucent highlight rectangle appears across all three panels during the drag. Release to zoom into that range. The selection must span at least 1% of the current x-axis range to trigger zoom. Zoom applies to all three subplots.

**Double-Click Reset**
Double-click any subplot to reset the zoom to the full data extent.

#### Live vs. Archive Mode

**Live Mode:**
The dialog shows all observations received via MQTT since the vehicle first appeared in the current session. The plot updates automatically as new observations arrive.

**Archive Mode:**
The dialog shows all observations from the archive MQTT log up to the current archive time. As you scrub the archive timeline or play forward, the plot updates dynamically to reflect the data available at that moment in the replay.

#### Color Palette

| Parameter | Color | Hex |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Temperature | Red | #FF6B6B |
| Dewpoint | Green | #3DDC84 |
| Wind Speed | Cyan | #4FC3F7 |
| Wind Direction | Gold | #FFD700 |
| Pressure | Purple | #B39DDB |

#### Unit Conversions

Wind speed is converted from m/s (stored in Observation records) to knots using the factor 1.94384.

#### Dialog Behavior

The dialog is reusable — if you close it and click TIMESERIES again for the same vehicle, the same dialog instance is raised and focused rather than creating a duplicate. Each vehicle has its own independent dialog instance.

---

## 7. Status Bar

The status bar runs along the bottom of the main window.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Left** | Mouse coordinates (lat/lon) and zoom level, updated live as you move the cursor over the map. Example: `35.2413 | -97.4521   Z 6.2` |
| **Center** | Status messages: "Ready" (default), "MQTT connected", error messages (e.g., "Radar fetch error: timeout") |
| **Right** | Current UTC clock (updates every second). Example: `18:45:32 UTC` |
| **Far right** | Network status indicator pill: **Green** = Online, **Yellow** = Slow (>1 s response), **Red** = Offline. Checked every 30 seconds via Cloudflare DNS. |

---

## 8. Archive Mode

Archive mode lets you replay any past session at a chosen UTC date and time. All data layers — radar, satellite, hazards, soundings, and vehicle positions — are fetched from historical archives and driven by a central time controller.

### Entering Archive Mode

Select **ARCHIVE** in the launch dialog, enter the passphrase, and choose a UTC start date/time using the calendar picker. Click **LAUNCH**. A loading dialog appears while STORM prefetches the initial data for each layer before playback begins.

The window title and status pill display the current archive timestamp while in this mode: `[ARCHIVE YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ]`.

---

### Archive Controls Bar

A controls bar appears at the top of the map window in archive mode (it is not visible in live modes).

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏮  ⏪  ▶  ⏩  ⏭   ──────── scrubber ────────   1×▾   Radar: OK  Sat: OK │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Playback Buttons

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ⏮ | Jump to the session start time |
| ⏪ | Step back 30 seconds of archive time |
| ▶ / ⏸ | Start / pause automatic playback |
| ⏩ | Step forward 30 seconds of archive time |
| ⏭ | Jump to the current real-world time (end of archive) |

#### Timeline Scrubber

Drag the slider to jump to any time within the archive session. The scrubber position represents seconds elapsed since midnight UTC of the session date.

#### Speed Selector

A dropdown next to the scrubber controls the playback speed multiplier:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 1× | Real-time (1 second of wall clock = 1 second of archive time) |
| 5× | 5 seconds of archive time per wall-clock second |
| 10× | — |
| 30× | — |
| 60× | — |
| 120× | — |
| 300× | 5 minutes of archive time per wall-clock second |

#### Layer Status Indicators

| Indicator | What It Shows |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Radar:** | Current radar fetch status ("OK", "waiting", "no data") |
| **Sat:** | Current satellite fetch status |

These update as each fetcher resolves data for the current archive timestamp.

---

### How Archive Data Works

| Layer | Source | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| NEXRAD Radar | Unidata THREDDS archive | Fetches Level 2 or Level 3 scans nearest to the current archive time |
| GOES Satellite | IEM WMS historical endpoint | Fetches the frame nearest to the current archive time |
| SPC/NWS Hazards | Archived GeoJSON products | Fetched once at session start for the session date |
| Soundings | open-meteo HRRR archive | Fetched on demand (map click), using archive time as valid time |
| Vehicle Positions | MQTT message log | Historical vehicle obs replayed in time order |

Each layer updates automatically as the archive clock advances. Data fetches are triggered when the clock crosses boundaries (e.g., every radar scan interval).

---

### Limitations in Archive Mode

- Vehicle positions are read from stored MQTT message logs — only vehicles that were active and publishing during the original session will appear.
- Real-time MQTT sync (annotations, drawings) is inactive in archive mode.
- Local file watcher (Track A) and GPS reader (Track B) are inactive.
- Network connectivity is still required — archive data is fetched from remote servers at playback time.

---

## 9. Outlook Text Panel

The Outlook Panel is a right-side panel that expands horizontally to display the full text of SPC and NWS products.

**Opening the Panel:**
Click any SPC feature (outlook area, watch polygon, or MD polygon) on the map, then click "Read" or "Read Discussion" in the popup.

**What Appears:**
- **Title bar:** Product name (e.g., "DAY 1 CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK", "MD 0179", "TORNADO WATCH 0029")
- **Close button (×):** Collapses the panel
- **Text area:** Full monospaced text of the product (read-only, scrollable)

**Text Sources:**

| Product | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Day 1 Outlook | IEM AFOS (`pil=SWODY1`) |
| Mesoscale Discussions | SPC direct (`spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md{NNNN}.txt`) |
| Tornado Watches | IEM AFOS (`pil=SEL{n}` where n = watch_number % 10) |
| SVR Tstm Watches | IEM AFOS (same PIL logic as tornado) |
| NWS Warnings | NWS API JSON (`headline` + `description` + `instruction` fields) |

**Animation:** Expands in from the right edge (200 ms), collapses on close (200 ms). Panel is 340 px wide.

---

## 10. Point Soundings

STORM supports three independent sounding sources, selected via the **SOUNDINGS** drawer (see [Section 6.4](#64-soundings)). All three sources display in the same Skew-T log-P dialog.

### HRRR Model Soundings

Click any map location within the HRRR CONUS domain. Data fetched from open-meteo (free tier, no API key required). The dialog opens automatically when data arrives (typically 1–3 seconds). Clicking a new location updates the same dialog in place.

### Observed Radiosonde Soundings

Switch to OBS mode in the SOUNDINGS drawer. Radiosonde station markers appear on the map at active upper-air sites. Click a marker to fetch the most recent balloon launch profile from IEM RAOB. STORM automatically selects the 00Z or 12Z launch closest to the current UTC time.

### NSSL CLAMPS DL Truck Soundings

Switch to NSSL mode in the SOUNDINGS drawer. CLAMPS truck markers appear when data is available from the NSSL THREDDS fileserver. Click a marker to fetch and display the most recent truck sounding. Up to 12 hours of soundings per truck are available.

## 11. Vehicle Tracking & Observations

STORM tracks vehicles through several parallel data input channels. All inputs feed into the live vehicle state used by the vehicle panel, station plots, and map markers.

### Track A — Local File Watcher

Polls a FOFS truck logger format file every 10 seconds. Enabled only if a data directory was selected at launch.

**Expected filename:** `YYYYMMDD.txt` (today's date)

**Expected columns (tab or comma delimited):**

| Column | Format | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `gps_date` | DDMMYY | GPS date |
| `gps_time` | HHMMSS | GPS time (UTC) |
| `lat` | decimal degrees | Latitude |
| `lon` | decimal degrees | Longitude |
| `t_fast` | °F | Fast-response temperature |
| `dewpoint` | °F | Dewpoint temperature |
| `sfc_wspd` | knots | Surface wind speed |
| `sfc_wdir` | degrees | Surface wind direction |
| `pressure` | mb | Atmospheric pressure |

### Track B — GPS Reader

Automatically detects and reads NMEA sentences from a connected serial GPS device. Provides position-only data (no met obs). Active only if `--disable-data-inputs` is not passed.

### MQTT — Inbound Vehicle Observations

Receives observations from other vehicles via the `storm/vehicles/{id}` topic. Active whenever MQTT is connected and not disabled.

## 12. Network & MQTT Sync

STORM uses MQTT over AWS IoT (TLS) to synchronize annotations, drawings, cones, and vehicle observations across all connected vehicles in the network.

### Topics

| Topic | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `storm/vehicles/{id}` | Vehicle observations (lat, lon, temp, dewpoint, wind, pressure) |
| `storm/annotations/{id}` | Road condition annotations (create / edit / delete) |
| `storm/drawings/{id}` | Meteorological drawings (fronts, polylines, polygons) |
| `storm/cones/{id}` | Storm motion cones |

### Behavior

- On connect, retained messages for all active annotations, drawings, and cones are received and displayed automatically.
- Disconnect/reconnect is handled automatically — STORM continuously attempts to reconnect with exponential backoff.
- If `--disable-mqtt` is passed, all sync features are disabled and the vehicle panel shows only locally-observed vehicles.
- Status bar shows "MQTT connected" or an error message.

## 14. Command-Line Options

Run `python main.py --help` for the full list. Key options:

### General

```
--debug                        Enable debug logging and the debug panel (Ctrl+D)
--log-level LEVEL              Logging verbosity: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (default: WARNING)
```

> **Note:** Mode selection (VEHICLE, MONITOR, VIEWER, ARCHIVE) is handled exclusively through the launch dialog to enforce passphrase authentication. There are no command-line flags for mode selection.

### Disable Features

```
--disable-radar                Hide the RADAR control; disable all radar fetching
--disable-mqtt                 Disable all MQTT features (sync, vehicle obs)
--disable-annotations          Disable annotations, drawings, station plots, and cones
--disable-deploy-locs          Disable deployment location markers
--disable-data-inputs          Disable local file watcher and GPS reader
```

### Replay Mode

```
--truck-replay-file PATH        Replay a local obs CSV/TXT file instead of live data
--truck-replay-interval-ms MS   Interval between replayed samples (default: 1000 ms)
--truck-replay-restamp          Shift timestamps so the last obs lands at "now"
```

### Performance

```
--render-grid-size N            Radar rendering grid: 128, 256, 512, 768, 1024, or 1536
```

### Debug Run Profiles

```
--debug-run N                  Quick diagnostic profile (0–6):
                                0 = full features
                                1 = disable MQTT only
                                2 = safe mode (minimal features, low grid size)
                                3–6 = various feature subsets for testing
--enable-startup-toggles        Allow CLI disable flags to override the debug-run profile
```

### Network

```
--mqtt-no-tls                  MQTT without TLS (development use only, not for field use)
```

---

## 15. Configuration & Certificates

### config.py

Edit `config.py` for persistent defaults:

| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ACCENT_COLOR` | UI accent color (default: `"#00CFFF"`, cyan) |
| `VEHICLE_ID` | Default vehicle ID (overridden by launch dialog) |
| `OBS_FILE_DIR` | Default data directory path (overridden by launch dialog) |
| `MQTT_HOST` | AWS IoT endpoint hostname |
| `MQTT_PORT` | MQTT port (default: 8883 for TLS) |
| `MQTT_USE_TLS` | Whether to require TLS (default: True) |

### Persistent Session State (QSettings)

The following are saved automatically and restored at next launch:
- Window geometry and dock layout
- Last-used vehicle ID
- Last-used data directory

Settings are stored under the `"NSSL" / "STORM"` namespace in your OS's native settings storage.

### TLS Certificate Files

Place these three files exactly at these paths before using MQTT:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `/aws/storm.pem` | CA certificate |
| `/aws/storm.pem.crt` | Device certificate |
| `/aws/storm-private.pem.key` | Private key |

Missing certificates cause MQTT to fail silently — all other features remain operational.

## 16. Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Escape** | Cancel active drawing / annotation placement / measurement mode |
| **Ctrl+D** | Toggle debug panel |
| **Ctrl+E** | Toggle error log panel |
| **Right-click** | Finish drawing or measurement in progress |

---

## 17. Performance Tuning

### Radar Grid Size

The radar rendering grid controls the sharpness and rendering time of the NEXRAD overlay.

| Grid Size | Render Time (approx.) | Recommended Use |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 128 | ~5–10 ms | Very slow hardware, emergency fallback |
| 256 | ~20–40 ms | Older laptops, safe-mode deployments |
| 512 | ~80–150 ms | Balanced quality/speed |
| **768** | **~200–400 ms** | **Default starting point in dynamic mode** |
| 1024 | ~400–800 ms | Workstation-class machines only |
| 1536 | ~900–1800 ms | Maximum sharpness, very fast machines only |

Pass `--render-grid-size N` to override. Lower grid sizes make the radar appear blockier but keep the CPU free for other tasks.

### Memory Usage

| Component | Approximate Memory |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Radar frame cache (12 frames) | 20–50 MB |
| CONUS satellite cache (10 frames) | 10–20 MB |
| MESO satellite cache (10 frames/sector) | 20–30 MB per sector |
| Station plot image cache | ~1–5 MB (per vehicle) |
| Observation history buffer (10 min/vehicle) | Negligible |

### Safe Mode

If the application is unstable on older hardware (WebGL context loss, slow renders), launch with:
```bash
python main.py --debug-run 2
```
Safe mode reduces grid size to 128, disables some overlays, and minimizes background polling.

---

## 18. Diagnostics & Error Handling

### Debug Mode

```bash
python main.py --debug
```

Enables:
- Verbose logging to console (DEBUG level)
- The debug panel (also toggled with **Ctrl+D** at any time)
- Fault handler writing stack traces to `storm_fault.log` on crash

### Error Log Panel

Press **Ctrl+E** at any time to open the error log panel. It shows all WARNING-level and above log messages captured since launch. This log is also written to `storm_errors.log` and survives across restarts.

### Network Status Indicator

The colored pill in the bottom-right of the status bar updates every 30 seconds:
- **Green (Online):** Connectivity to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 is fast
- **Yellow (Slow):** Response time exceeded 1 second — data fetches may be delayed
- **Red (Offline):** No connectivity — no real-time data will update

### Single-Instance Guard

STORM uses an internal TCP port (19876) as a process lock. If a second instance is launched while one is already running, a dialog warns the user and the second instance exits.

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Radar not updating | THREDDS server unavailable or slow | Check network indicator; try a different site |
| "MQTT disconnected" in status bar | Certificate missing or endpoint unreachable | Verify `/aws/` certificate files exist |
| Station plots missing | `--disable-annotations` passed | Relaunch without that flag |
| MESO-1/2 buttons grayed out | Sectors not currently available | Wait — buttons enable automatically when sectors are active |
| Map tiles blank/gray | `storm.mbtiles` missing or corrupted | Verify the MBTiles file is present and not zero-byte |
| Slow/choppy radar rendering | Grid size too large for hardware | Use `--render-grid-size 256` |
| Hatch patterns not visible | WebGL limitation | Known quirk; patterns are built as pixel data, not canvas — should render in all supported modes |

---

## 19. Known Limitations & Quirks

**Canvas Readback**
MapLibre GL running inside QWebEngineView cannot reliably read back canvas pixel data. Hatch patterns (CIG/SIGN significant areas) are therefore built entirely as raw `Uint8Array` pixel data and added to MapLibre via `addImage()`, rather than drawn on a canvas. This is a known architectural constraint.

**QWebChannel Async Initialization**
The `bridge` object that connects Python and JavaScript is initialized asynchronously after the map loads. All JavaScript API functions are stubbed as no-ops (`_stormNoop`) until the bridge is ready. In practice this is transparent to the user, but very rapid actions in the first second after launch may be silently dropped.

**MBTiles File Not Included in Repository**
The offline vector tile database (`storm.mbtiles`) is large (500 MB–1 GB) and is not included in the git repository. It must be downloaded separately and placed in the project root.

**SPC Text Product Latency**
IEM AFOS sometimes responds slowly (up to 20 seconds per request). STORM waits patiently rather than timing out aggressively. This is normal behavior during high-traffic SPC issuance periods.

**MESO Sectors Availability**
GOES MESO-1 and MESO-2 sectors are not always active or available over your area of interest. STORM automatically enables/disables the MESO buttons based on sector availability. This is a function of NOAA's operational GOES scanning schedule.

**GOES Satellite Band**
The IEM WMS endpoint serves the default operational visible or IR band for the current GOES satellite. Band selection is not user-configurable from within STORM.

**SPC Data Lag**
SPC GeoJSON products (tor, wind, hail) are typically updated once or twice daily. They may not reflect very recent issuances until the next polling cycle completes (up to 15 minutes after the fact). SPC Watches and MDs poll every 2 minutes and are effectively near-real-time.
